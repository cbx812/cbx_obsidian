## Technical specifications

### MP\&R™ Model ME7.5 Twin-Screw Extruder

This extruder is designed using mathematical modeling and built for the distribution and coating of energetic nanoparticles. The twin screws have a diameter of 7.5 mm, are co-rotating, fully intermeshing and self wiping with an L/D of 15/1. The barrel is horizontally split and held together with quick release clamps, allowing quick opening and easy access to the agitators. The barrel and die are cored and zoned for circulation of heating or cooling fluid. It is constructed of 17-4 ph stainless steel in condition H-1150 and is ferritic nitro carburized yielding a surface hardness of 62 RC and a low coefficient of friction. It contains two main feed ports (for feeding solids and/or liquids ) and a vent port for drawing vacuum. The system is capable of temperatures up to 4500 F and pressures of 1500 psig.
该挤出机是使用数学模型设计的，并为高能纳米颗粒的分布和涂层而构建。双螺杆具有7.5毫米的直径，共同旋转，完全啮合和自擦拭，L/D为15/1。枪管是水平分开的，并用快速释放夹固定在一起，可以快速打开并轻松进入搅拌器。桶和模具被芯化并分区，用于加热或冷却流体的循环。它由条件H-1150的17-4 ph不锈钢制成，并经过铁素体硝基渗碳处理，表面硬度为62 RC，摩擦系数低。它包含两个主要进料口 (用于进料固体和/或液体) 和一个抽真空的排气口。该系统能够温度高达4500 F和压力1500 psig。

The solid agitators are designed and built on a custom basis for each application via computer modeling. They are precision tooled from solid bar stock thereby yielding better torsional and bending strengths versus segmented designs for these small diameters. Screw to barrel clearance is less than .002 inches. The machine is supplied with a novel agitator shaft arrangement which can be quickly removed without tools. The agitators are driven with a hydrostatic drive system as standard equipment requiring 110V or an optional variable frequency AC drive for non explosion proof applications. The in-line die is cored and zoned for temperature control and instrumented with a control thermocouple and combination pressure/temperature transducer. The standard die is a slit design, but the die geometry can be designed via mathematical modeling and rheological characterization of the material to generate the desired extrudate shape.
固体搅拌器是通过计算机建模在每个应用程序的自定义基础上设计和构建的。它们是由实心棒材精密加工而成，从而产生更好的扭转和弯曲强度，与这些小直径的分段设计相比。螺杆与机筒的间隙小于.002英寸。该机器提供了一种新颖的搅拌器轴装置，无需工具即可快速拆卸。搅拌器采用静液压驱动系统作为标准设备，需要110V或可选的变频交流驱动，用于非防爆应用。在线模具的芯和分区温度控制，并配备控制热电偶和组合压力/温度传感器。标准模具是狭缝设计，但是可以通过数学建模和材料的流变特性来设计模具的几何形状，以生成所需的挤出物形状。
