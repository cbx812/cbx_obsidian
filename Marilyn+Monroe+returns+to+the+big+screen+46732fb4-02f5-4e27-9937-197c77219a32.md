**玛丽莲·梦露重回大银幕**

Marilyn Monroe was a famous American movie actress from the 1950s and early 1960s.Her life is being detailed in a new movie on Netflix, Blonde. It stars Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe.

Monroe was well-known for her costumes in the movies. She wore a bright pink long dress to sing the song Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend. And most famously, she wore a white dress that blew up as she walked over the subway in the movie The Seven Year Itch.

玛丽莲·梦露是20世纪50年代和60年代初美国著名的电影女演员。网飞的一部新电影《金发女郎》详细描述了她的生活。安娜·德·阿尔马斯在片中饰演玛丽莲·梦露。

梦露因她在电影中的服装而闻名。她穿着一件亮粉色的长裙，唱着歌曲《钻石是女孩最好的朋友》。最著名的是，在电影《七年之痒》中，她穿着一件白色连衣裙，在走过地铁时，被微风吹起。

The costumes have been talked about in popular culture. They have been recreated and reimagined many times in Hollywood movies and even in low-cost clothing shops. In 2011, the famous white dress that Monroe wore was bought for $4.6 million.

她的服装在流行文化中被津津乐道。在好莱坞电影中，甚至在低成本的服装店中，梦露的服装多次被重新塑造和再现。2011年，梦露穿的那件著名的白色连衣裙以460万美元的价格售出。

不过，玛丽莲·梦露另一件衣服卖出了更高的价格。

The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to sing “Happy Birthday” to President John F.Kennedy during his 45th birthday party sold for a record breaking 4.8 million dollars.

Ripley’s Believe it or Not purchased this sparkly number at an auction house in Los Angeles on Thursday,Nov.17th, making it the most expensive dress ever sold at auction.

梦露曾穿着这件衣服在肯尼迪总统45岁生日宴会上为总统唱“生日快乐”歌，这件衣服最终以破纪录的价格480万美元拍卖。

雷普利信不信由你奇趣博物馆于11月17号周四在洛杉矶的拍卖行买下了这件闪闪发亮的衣服，这件裙子由此成了史上拍卖价最高的裙子。

Monroe’s iconic performance in 1962 was made memorable in part by her outfit. The dress features more than 2500 hand-stitched crystals and it was apparently so slim, the actress had to be sewn into it.

梦露1962年的表演永载史册，这件裙子也有功劳。裙子上手工镶满2500颗水晶，而且显得很瘦，以至于不得不为梦露合身缝制。

Monroe’s breathy performance also helped fuel rumors of an affair between her and the former president. Edward Meyer, Ripley’s vice president of Exhibits and Archives said "this is the most famous item of clothing in 20th century culture. It has the significance of Marilyn,of Hollywood, of JFK,of American politics.”

梦露精彩的表演让其和前总统的绯闻愈演愈烈。雷普利展品部副总裁爱德华说“这是20世纪文化史上最著名的裙子。它和梦露，好莱坞，肯尼迪以及美国政治都有关联，非常有意义和价值。”

And a copy of the dress went for $120,000 several years later. That explains why Jennifer Johnson felt a lot of pressure to get the costumes just right for the movie Blonde. As costume designer for the movie, Johnson was not able to study Monroe's costumes in person.

几年后，那件连衣裙的复制品以12万美元的价格售出。这就解释了为什么詹妮弗·约翰逊在为电影《金发女郎》准备合适的服装时感到压力很大。作为电影的服装设计师，约翰逊无法亲自研究梦露的服装。

Johnson and her team watched films, looked at photos, and used information from a book by William Travilla who was responsible for Monroe's famous looks. Even though the team could not use the same materials to make the costumes for Blonde, Johnson said it was important that the structure of the dresses was similar, so that they would not look like low-priced copies.

约翰逊和她的团队看了电影，看了照片，并使用了威廉·特拉维拉的一本书中的信息，这本书对梦露的著名容貌描写的淋漓尽致。尽管团队无法使用相同的材料为金发女郎制作服装，但约翰逊表示，重要的是裙子的结构要相似，这样看起来就不会像廉价的复制品。

She had read in Travilla's book about problems that happened with the dresses. For example, when the pink dress was not moving correctly when Monroe walked down the stairs in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,Travilla used green felt, a material usually found on pool tables, to support the dress.

她在特拉维拉的书中读到了关于裙子出现的问题。例如，当梦露在《绅士爱美人》中走下楼梯时，粉色连衣裙没有正确移动，特拉维拉就用绿色毛毡来支撑连衣裙，这种材料通常在台球桌上找到。

While Johnson did not use the same pool table material as Travilla, she understood the issue and recreated the dress with new material. Johnson said that it is always easier to make new clothes than to find something old. "It's quite hard to find existing things," she said.

虽然约翰逊没有使用与特拉维拉相同的台球桌材料，但她理解了这个问题，并用新材料重新制作了这件连衣裙。“很难找到现存的东西，”她说。

The most difficult one to recreate was, of course, the white dress from The Seven Year Itch. The dress has many pleats in which the material is folded over itself. It needs a special structure that few places can make anymore.

最难重现的当然是《七年之痒》中的白色连衣裙。这件连衣裙有许多褶皱，布料可以折叠起来。它需要一种特别的结构，几乎没有地方可以再做了。

Johnson said it took about 45 meters of material for her team to recreate the white dress because of problems with the pleats. "It was incredible how much fabric it took to create the arc and the drama of that dress when it blows up with the subway grate..." she said.

约翰逊说，由于褶皱的问题，她的团队花了大约45米的材料才重现了这件白色连衣裙。她说：“令人难以置信的是，梦露穿的白裙在风栅上被风吹起的这个效果——弧线和戏剧效果——是用了很多布料才实现的。”

But in the end, it was worth creating that special moment. "It's so beautifully shot by Chayse Irvin, our amazing cinematographer," Johnson said. Monroe's everyday style was more casual. Johnson and Andrew Dominik, the director, dressed Ana de Armas as Monroe with Capri pants that are cut off just below the knee and sweaters.

但归根结底，创造那个特别的时刻是值得的。“我们的摄影师查斯·欧文拍得非常漂亮，”约翰逊说。梦露的日常生活风格更加随意。约翰逊和导演安德鲁·多米尼克将安娜·德·阿尔马斯打扮成梦露，穿着卡普里七分裤和毛衣。

Some of the pieces were old clothes found in Los Angeles costume houses. Johnson wanted the clothes to be as natural as possible to fit de Armas's body and to be understood by modern movie watchers.

其中一些是在洛杉矶服装店发现的旧衣服。约翰逊希望衣服尽可能自然，以适应德·阿尔马斯的身材，并被现代电影观众理解。

Johnson then added, "Those dresses are so iconic, they could easily overtake the actor and become all about the costume. And I always wanted it to be complementary to Ana's incredible performance."

约翰逊接着补充道：“这些连衣裙是如此具有标志性，它们很容易超越演员，成为电影的全部戏眼。我一直希望它能与安娜出色的演技相辅相成。”费斯·皮尔洛为您播报。
